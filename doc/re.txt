RE is alive when:
 1. RE port has link, AND
 2. RE port is FORWARDING on RE VLAN.

Thus RE becomes dead when:
 1. RE port loses link, OR
 2. RE port loses membership in RE VLAN, OR
 3. RE port STP state on RE VLAN becomes not FORWARDING.

This means that to know RE state we need to monitor:
 1. RE port link state.
 2. RE port mode:
    1. ACCESS means that the port is a member of its access VLAN only,
       so we also need to monitor port access VLAN.
    2. TRUNK means that the port is a member of all VLANs.
 3. RE VLAN STG membership.
 4. RE port/STG STP state.

VLAN is alive when at least 1 member port:
 1. Has link, AND
 2. Is FORWARDING on VLAN.

This means that to know VLAN state we need to monitor:
 1. Port modes:
    1. ACCESS means that the port is a member of its access VLAN only,
       so we also need to monitor port access VLAN.
    2. TRUNK means that the port is a member of all VLANs.
 2. Port link states.
 3. VLAN STG membership.
 4. Port/STG STP state.
